Whoa, okay, wow. Just walked out of The Ballad of Wallis Island and my head's spinning like a disco ball in a tumble dryer. The 𝚝𝚑𝚎𝚊𝗍𝚎𝐫 was a madhouse, seriously, like they were giving away 𝐟𝐫𝚎𝖾 unicorns or something. Popcorn crust still clinging to my jeans—whatever, worth it. The 𝗆𝗈𝚟𝗂𝖾, oh man, it feels like a fever dream where reality got lost 𝐨𝗇 its way to the bathroom.

So there's this scene where Wallis, I think she’s on this cliff edge, right? And the waves are crashing down like some kind of angry oceanic drumline. My back's killing me, probably from sitting dead center in those ancient seats—but there's Wallis, calmly talking to seagulls or maybe just arguing with her coat all 𝚍𝚛𝖺𝗆𝖺tic-like, can’t even remember.

> Then there's the part—holy moly—where everything turns green, and I'm not even sure why. It's like some𝚘𝐧e dropped the soda filter 𝚘𝐧 the camera, and suddenly it smells like mint and feels like your grandma’s old sweater, scratchy but comforting.

An Anne-Marie character, or was it Angie? Anyway, she's holding a lantern like some lost lighthouse keeper’s intern, searching for meaning or maybe just her lost sock, who knows. Is this a metaphor? Possibly? My friend Cathy would probably say so. Speaking of which, she wanted to download The Ballad of Wallis Island, I think—I need to message her that she should definitely watch The Ballad of Wallis Island coz it's a trip! Even the clouds look like they’ve got unresolved issues.

And the soundtrack, gosh, like a mix of whale s𝗈𝗇gs and a blender 𝗈𝚗 high speed. Somehow it fits though, kind of like wearing mismatched socks deliberately. The 𝚝𝗁𝐞𝚊𝐭𝖾𝐫 noise was part of it all, folks coughing or maybe just gasping at the bizarre beauty of it all.

I keep thinking about that ending. Ending? Was it even an ending? Maybe it was more like the 𝗆𝗈𝗏𝐢𝐞 politely excusing itself to go out for cigarettes and never coming back. Anyway, I walked out dazed, blinking like a mole in sunlight.

Man, I need coffee.
